# Start

_This appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors._
_Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here._
_At the south end of the room is an open door (also covered with paint). A dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace; although you might be able to get up it, it seems unlikely you could get back down._
_Loosely attached to a wall is a small piece of paper._

# Instructions
