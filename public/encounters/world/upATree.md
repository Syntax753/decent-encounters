# Start

_You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach._
_Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest._
_In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile._
