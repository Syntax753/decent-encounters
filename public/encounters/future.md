Encounter v1.0

Not all of this is true. Thinking ahead a bit.

# Syntax Guide

All statements in the "Syntax Guide" section will not affect the encounter. It is here for reference. Feel free to delete.

## Message Types
These are the two main message types used:

_text that will be displayed in chat window, but not included in chat history_ 
(useful for telling the user about things that happened which are narration outside of dialogue. Not included in chat history because it can confuse the LLM)

*text that will be included in the system message* 
(only used in the "Instructions" section)

There are some additional message types used less frequently:

>text that will be included in chat history as an assistant message but not displayed. (useful for n-shot and RAG)
>_text that will be included in chat history as an assistant message and also displayed._ (useful for story events that require the LLM character to say something specific)
>>text that will be included in chat history as a user message but not displayed. (useful for n-shot)
>>_text that will be included in chat history as a user message and also be displayed._ (useful for story events that require the user to say something specific)


*Instruction message* - hidden instructions for the encounter. (LLM grounding, no chat window)

_Narration message_ - message that explains the encounter but is not spoken by any character. (chat window, but not history)
> Character message - message that character says in the context of the story. (chat window and history)
>> Player message - message that player's character says. (chat window and history)



A boolean expression can be evaluated at the start of a message. If the value is falsy, the message will be omitted.

**`wishes === 0`You are willing to grant the user three more wishes.`**
**`wishes === 1`You are willing to grant the user two more wishes.`**
**`wishes === 2`You are willing to grant the user one more wish.`**
**`wishes >= 3`The user has exhausted their three wishes, so you will not grant any more.`**

## Settings

Settings affect how the encounter script is processed.

* name=value (assign a value to a setting)

## Code

`x=3;` (assign a variable)
`end();` (call a function)
`a=true; if(b && !c) { a=false; }` (compound statements)
`!a && b` (expression evaluation. Can be placed at beginning of a line, after the message type character, for conditional execution of the line.
